"Edgar Degas’s famous statue of a ballerina came to the
Museum as part of the bequest of Louisine Havemeyer Together
with numerous paintings and sketches by the artist Mrs
Havemeyer donated seventy-one of his bronzes the first
nearly complete set of the artist’s works in bronze to enter
any museum 1

The wealthy and adventurous collector’s
interest in Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer dates to her
first glimpse of the wax model for it on view in 1881 at the
Paris Salon Self-taught in sculpture Degas made numerous wax
models on wire armatures The subjects —  dancers women
bathing and horses —  also feature in his paintings but the
sculptural studies are not preparatory for specific oil
canvases as much as they are independent explorations of
three-dimensional form He showed the waxes to friends and
ordered plaster casts of three of them during his lifetime
so their creation was not an entirely private activity2 Yet
the only one he ever exhibited in public was the wax version
of Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer National Gallery of Art
Washington DC  3 Degas decided to make the sculpture of
tinted wax with real cloth tulle and ribbon and the result
reminded many viewers of the displays in Madame Tussaud’s
wax museum in London The glass vitrine in which it was shown
at the Salon also called to mind the wax mannequins in a
costume show at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1879 4
Mrs Havemeyer’s reaction to Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer
in 1881 not only reveals her own enthusiasm but conveys the
impression the sculpture made on the public at large Paris
could scarcely maintain its equilibrium 　　 Degas became the
hero of the hour His name was on all lips his statue
discussed by all the art world  5 Long　afterward she
continued to be smitten by the wax model and attempted to
buy it in 1903 After the artist’s death in 1917 his heirs
engaged the Hébrard foundry to cast bronzes of seventy-two
of the waxes that survived in Degas’s studio Little Dancer
the seventy-third was cast separately They were produced in
editions of twenty plus one for the heirs and one for the
foundry When the Musée du Louvre failed in its effort to
acquire the first bronze set of Degas’s sculpture —  the set
marked A —  Mrs Havemeyer advised by her influential friend
the American painter Mary Cassatt succeeded in buying it
during its premier exhibition at the Galerie A A Hébrard in
Paris in May 1921

The largest of the wax models the Little
Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer was also cast in multiples
Hébrard’s chief bronze founder Albino Palazzolo used the wax
sculpture to create two plaster models now in the Joslyn Art
Museum Omaha Nebraska and National Gallery of Art Washington
DC and they served as the basis for twenty-nine known
bronzes most of which were produced between 1922 and 1937 6
Cast in 1922 and marked A because it is part of the first
set the Museum’s bronze has a tinted bodice a tutu made of
cotton and a hair ribbon of satin both original fabrics have
been replaced to replicate the appearance of the original
wax model

Much has been written about the genesis of Little
Fourteen-Year- Old Dancer and its importance in the history
of modern sculpture Mrs Havemeyer’s recollection of the
sculpture in her autobiography is useful for assessing its
position in the history of art To some it was a revelation
to others an enigma The graceful figure was as classic as an
Egyptian statue and as modern as Degas 　　 All Paris said 　　
Who has achieved this wonderful creation Whoever he is he is
modern to his finger tips and as ancient as the pyramids 7
Some of the statue’s power comes from the rigid frontality
of the pose a reference to ancient Egyptian statuary that
was recognized by the artist’s contemporaries At the same
time its realism shocked viewers

Degas’s model was the
young Marie van Goethem born June 7 1865 a student at the
École de Danse and by 1880 a professional dancer at the
Paris Opéra Degas’s sketches of Marie indicate his intense
concentration on her form The artist frequented the Opéra
making endless studies of dancers in motion and at rest In
the bronze his model has adopted a classic ballet stance
with her right leg advanced and turned Yet there is a
deliberate awkwardness to the pose —  in the uncompromising
way that the arms jut down behind and the head tilts back
moreover the features of this precocious adolescent are far
from pretty Unorthodox yet riveting Degas’s Little Fourteen-
Year-Old Dancer became an instant icon in the history of
sculpture

"에드가 드가의 작품  열네 살의 어린 무용수는 1922년에 주조된 청동
조각상으로 2018년에 새로운 튜튜를 장착하여 복원되었습니다  

이 작품은
드가가 평생 동안 탐구한 주제인 발레리나를 묘사하고 있습니다


드가는
발레리나의 삶을 사실적으로 묘사하는 데 관심이 많았습니다  

그는 화려한
무대 뒤의 피곤하고 지친 모습을 보여주는 것을 좋아했습니다  

열네 살의
어린 무용수는 이러한 드가의 관심을 잘 보여줍니다


조각상은 젊은
발레리나가 의자에 앉아있는 모습을 보여줍니다 

그녀는 지쳐 보이고 몸은
힘없이 축 처져 있으며 표정은 침착하거나 슬픔에 잠긴 듯합니다  

그녀의
자세는 무대의 화려함과는 거리가 멀고 피곤함과 고독이 느껴집니다
드가는 그녀의 몸을 섬세하게 조각하여 젊은 소녀의 연약함과 피로를
생생하게 드러냅니다  

섬세한 손과 발 그리고 옷의 주름은 매우 사실적으로
표현되어 있습니다  

어린 소녀의 몸은 힘들어 보이지만 동시에 아름다움과
젊음을 간직하고 있습니다


이 작품은 단순한 발레리나의 모습을 넘어
젊은 시절의 힘듦과 성장통을 상징적으로 보여줍니다  

어린 나이에 엄격한
훈련을 받고  끊임없는 노력과 희생을 요구받는 발레리나의 삶을 은유적으로
표현하고 있다고 해석할 수 있습니다


2018년 튜튜의 복원은 작품의
가치를 더욱 높였습니다  

원래의 튜튜는 시간이 흘러 손상되었을 가능성이
높으나  복원 작업을 통해 드가가 의도했던 발레리나의 모습을 보다
완벽하게 재현할 수 있게 되었습니다


결론적으로 열네 살의 어린
무용수는 단순한 아름다움을 넘어  인간의 감정과 삶의 고뇌를 표현하는
깊이 있는 작품입니다  

드가의 뛰어난 조각 실력과  발레리나에 대한 깊은
이해가 어우러져  관객에게 강렬한 인상을 남기는 명작입니다"
