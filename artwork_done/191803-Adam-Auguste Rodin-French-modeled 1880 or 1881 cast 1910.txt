"Auguste Rodin’s first commission from the French government
The Gates of Hell was intended to be the portal for a new
building to house the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris but
that edifice was never constructed Nonetheless Rodin worked
on the project for two decades exhibiting a plaster version
of The Gates in public for the first time in 1900 Even
though the colossal doorway was never cast in bronze in his
lifetime the numerous figures he invented for it inspired
many of his finished sculptures and some became independent
works of art in their own right1 In a letter of October 20
1881 to the commissioners at the Ministère de l’Instruction
Publique et des Beaux-Arts the sculptor referred to two
colossal figures that will stand at either side of the
gates 2 Albert Elsen identified them as Adam and Eve the
original sinners as seen in an early sketch by the artist 3
The sculptor had exhibited a plaster of Adam at the Paris
Salon of 1881 so he may have invented the figure before he
thought of associating it with the government’s
architectural project Rodin later produced versions of Adam
and Eve as independent compositions Nonetheless Adam can be
considered as a flanking element and as pendant to Eve
111732 Both figures tuck their heads into their shoulders in
Eve’s case her remorse is evident as she hides behind her
arms In contrast to her more fluid form Adam’s body is
defined by taut musculature two deliberately awkward arms
reach down in parallel movements and his bent knee tightens
the leg tendons Both bodies also twist —  ​overtly in Adam’s
case with more subtlety in Eve’s —  ​as if toward each other
across the doors they were intended to flank

Adam is one of
a series of powerful male nudes that established Rodin as a
major sculptor in the 1870s and early 1880s They include The
Age of Bronze Metropolitan Museum of Art  4 and Saint John
the Baptist Preaching Museum of Modern Art New York Of these
Adam offers the clearest homage to Michelangelo whose
marbles such as the Dying Slave and Rebellious Slave
Accademia Florence and Musée du Louvre Paris and fresco The
Creation of Adam on the Sistine Ceiling in the Vatican Rodin
had passionately admired and studied in Italy before he
returned home in 1876 5 Adam’s extended right forefinger
alludes to the awakening gesture in Michelangelo’s painted
Creation scene

This particular sculpture helped to
establish Rodin’s reputation in America The New York
investor Thomas Fortune Ryan who collected works by Rodin as
well as Italian Renaissance art gave several of the French
artist’s marbles to the Museum he also contributed funds to
purchase other works by the man generally recognized as the
greatest living sculptor In 1910 one of the foremost
American sculptors Daniel Chester French who was chairman of
the Museum’s Sculpture Committee visited Rodin’s studio in
Meudon with Vice Director Edward Robinson at that time they
commissioned the present work which is evidently the first
bronze cast from a plaster model that Rodin had created
several decades before6 Two years later the Museum dedicated
a gallery to Rodin’s work a tribute it has rarely accorded
to a living artist this was an especially noteworthy event
since the display preceded the establishment of the Musée
Rodin in Paris by four years and the founding of the Museum
of Modern Art in New York by seventeen years In the new
gallery the bronze Adam and Eve were joined by some forty
other sculptures and drawings many of them gifts from the
artist himself Based on this core collection the Museum has
assembled a comprehensive representation of Rodin’s work in
all media executed throughout his career 7

"아담 아우구스트 로댕 프랑스 조각가의 작품에 대한 5분 설명입니다
로댕의 아담은 1880년 또는 1881년에 제작된  모델링 작품이며
1910년에 주조되었습니다


이 작품은 인간의 기원과 순수함을 탐구하는
로댕의 깊은 관심을 보여주는 작품입니다


아담은 흔히 알려진 성경적
인물이 아닌 더 원초적이고 자연스러운 인간의 모습으로 묘사됩니다
로댕은 아담을 단순히 벌거벗은 인물이 아닌  생명력이 넘치고 강인한
존재로 표현했습니다


그의 몸은 근육질이지만 동시에 부드러운 곡선을
가지고 있어 역동적이면서도 평온한 느낌을 줍니다


얼굴은  평화롭고
사색적인 표정을 띠고 있으며 눈은 어딘가를 응시하고 있는 듯합니다


이
작품에서 로댕은 인체의 아름다움과  인간의 내면세계를 동시에 표현하려고
했습니다


그는 인체의 해부학적 정확성보다는  인체의 움직임과 감정을
표현하는 데 더욱 집중했습니다


따라서 아담의 자세는  자연스럽고
유동적이며  관찰자로 하여금 여러 가지 해석을 가능하게 합니다


로댕은
흙으로 조각을 빚은 듯한 질감을 표현하기 위해  표면을 거칠게
처리했습니다


이러한 표면처리는 아담의 원초적인 모습과  자연과의
연결성을 더욱 강조하는 효과를 가져옵니다


아담은 단순한 종교적 주제를
넘어  인간의 존재와  자연과의 관계에 대한  깊이 있는 성찰을
불러일으킵니다


그것은 인간의 탄생과  삶에 대한  로댕의 철학적인
사유를 보여주는 작품입니다


주조된 청동 작품은  원형 모델의 역동성과
섬세함을 잘 보존하고 있습니다


전 세계 많은 미술관과 개인 소장가들이
로댕의 아담을 소장하고 있으며


이 작품은 지금까지도 많은 사람들에게
영감을 주고 있습니다


로댕의 아담은  단순한 조각 작품을 넘어
인간의 본질에 대한  깊이 있는 질문을 던지는  예술 작품입니다
그것은 우리가 인간이라는 존재에 대해  새롭게 생각해 보도록 이끄는
작품입니다"
